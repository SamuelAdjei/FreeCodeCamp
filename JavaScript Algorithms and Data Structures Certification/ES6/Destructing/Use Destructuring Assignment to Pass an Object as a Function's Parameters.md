**Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters**

In some cases, you can destructure the object in a function argument itself.

Consider the code below:

```
const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
  const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;
  // do something with these variables
}
```

This effectively destructures the object sent into the function. This can also be done in-place:

```
const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {
  /* do something with these fields */
}
```

This removes some extra lines and makes our code look neat. This has the added benefit of not having to manipulate an entire object in a function â€” only the fields that are needed are copied inside the function.

---------------------

**CHALLENEGE**

Use destructuring assignment within the argument to the function `half` to send only `max` and `min` inside the function.

```
const stats = {
  max: 56.78,
  standard_deviation: 4.34,
  median: 34.54,
  mode: 23.87,
  min: -0.75,
  average: 35.85
};

// change code below this line
const half = (stats) => (stats.max + stats.min) / 2.0; // use function argument destructuring
// change code above this line

console.log(stats); // should be object
console.log(half(stats)); // should be 28.015

```

**SOLUTION**

```
const stats = {
  max: 56.78,
  standard_deviation: 4.34,
  median: 34.54,
  mode: 23.87,
  min: -0.75,
  average: 35.85
};

// change code below this line
const half = ({ max, min }) => (max + min) / 2.0;
// change code above this line

console.log(stats); // should be object
console.log(half(stats)); // should be 28.015

```
