**Handle a Rejected Promise with catch**

`catch` is the method used when your promise has been rejected. It is executed immediately after a promise's `reject` method is called. Hereâ€™s the syntax:

```

myPromise.catch(error => {
  // do something with the error.
});

```

`error` is the argument passed in to the `reject` method.

Note: the `then` and `catch` methods can be chained to the promise declaration if you choose.

---------------------

**CHALLENEGE**

Add the `catch` method to your promise. Use `error` as the parameter of its callback function and log `error` to the console.



```
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // responseFromServer is set to false to represent an unsuccessful response from a server
  let responseFromServer = false;
    
  if(responseFromServer) {
    resolve("We got the data");
  } else {  
    reject("Data not received");
  }
});

makeServerRequest.then(result => {
  console.log(result);
});


```

**SOLUTION**

```
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // responseFromServer is set to false to represent an unsuccessful response from a server
  let responseFromServer = false;
    
  if(responseFromServer) {
    resolve("We got the data");
  } else {  
    reject("Data not received");
  }
});

makeServerRequest.then(result => {
  console.log(result);
}).catch(error => {
  console.log(error)
});

```
