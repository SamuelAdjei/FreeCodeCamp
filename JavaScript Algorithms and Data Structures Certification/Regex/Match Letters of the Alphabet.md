**Match Letters of the Alphabet**

You saw how you can use character sets to specify a group of characters to match, but that's a lot of typing when you need to match a large range of characters (for example, every letter in the alphabet). Fortunately, there is a built-in feature that makes this short and simple.

Inside a character set, you can define a range of characters to match using a hyphen character: `-`.

For example, to match lowercase letters `a` through `e` you would use `[a-e]`.

```
let catStr = "cat";
let batStr = "bat";
let matStr = "mat";
let bgRegex = /[a-e]at/;
catStr.match(bgRegex); // Returns ["cat"]
batStr.match(bgRegex); // Returns ["bat"]
matStr.match(bgRegex); // Returns null
```

**CHALLENEGE**


```
let quoteSample = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
let alphabetRegex = /change/; // Change this line
let result = alphabetRegex; // Change this line

```

**SOLUTION**

```
let quoteSample = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
let alphabetRegex = /[a-z]/gi; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(alphabetRegex); // Change this line

```
