**Declare String Variables**

Previously we have used the code

`var myName = "your name";`

"your name" is called a string literal. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

----------------------
**CHALLENGE**

Create two new string variables: `myFirstName` and `myLastName` and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

1. `myFirstName` should be a string with at least one character in it.
2. `myLastName` should be a string with at least one character in it.

```
// Example
var firstName = "Alan";
var lastName = "Turing";

// Only change code below this line

```


**SOLUTION**

```
// Example
var firstName = "Alan";
var lastName = "Turing";

// Only change code below this line

var myFirstName = "Samuel";
var myLastName = "Adjei";
```
