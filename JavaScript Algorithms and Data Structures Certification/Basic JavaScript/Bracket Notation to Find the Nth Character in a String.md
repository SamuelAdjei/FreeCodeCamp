**Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String**

You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at `0`, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

**CHALLENEGE**

Let's try to set `thirdLetterOfLastName` to equal the third letter of the `lastName` variable using bracket notation.

Hint
Try looking at the `secondLetterOfFirstName` variable declaration if you get stuck.

1. The `thirdLetterOfLastName` variable should have the value of `v`.
2. You should use bracket notation.

```
// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName;

```

**SOLUTION**

```
// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];


```
