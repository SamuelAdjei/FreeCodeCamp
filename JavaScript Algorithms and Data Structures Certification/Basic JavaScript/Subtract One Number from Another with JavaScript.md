**Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript**

We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

**Example**

`myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6`

**CHALLENGE**
Change the `0` so the difference is `12`.

1. Make the variable `difference` equal 12.
2. Only subtract one number from 45.

`var difference = 45 - 0;`


**SOLUTION**
`var difference = 45 - 33;`
