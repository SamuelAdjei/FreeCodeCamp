**Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays**

With JavaScript `array` variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:
```
var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"]
```

---------------------

**CHALLENEGE**
Modify the new array `myArray` so that it contains both a `string` and a `number` (in that order).
1. `myArray` should be an array.
2. The first item in `myArray` should be a string.
3. The second item in `myArray` should be a number.


```
// Example
var ourArray = ["John", 23];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = [];

```

**SOLUTION**

```
// Example
var ourArray = ["John", 23];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = ["Car Park", 30];

```
