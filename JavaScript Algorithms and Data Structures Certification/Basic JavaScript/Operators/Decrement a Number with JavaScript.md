**Decrement a Number with JavaScript**

You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the `--` operator.

`i--;`

is the equivalent of

`i = i - 1;`

**Note**
The entire line becomes `i--;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.


**CHALLENGE**
Change the code to use the `--` operator on `myVar`.
1. `myVar` should equal `10`
2. `myVar = myVar - 1;` should be changed
3. Use the `--` operator on `myVar`
4. Do not change code above the line

`var myVar = 11;`

// Only change code below this line
`myVar = myVar - 1;`


---------------------------------------
**SOLUTION**

`var myVar = 11;`

// Only change code below this line

`myVar--;`
