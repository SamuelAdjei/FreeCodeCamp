**Increment a Number with JavaScript**

You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

`i++;`

is the equivalent of

`i = i + 1;`

**Note**
The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.


**CHALLENGE**
Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.
1. `myVar`should equal `88`
2. `myVar = myVar + 1;` should be changed
3. Use the `++` operator
4. Do not change code above the line


`var myVar = 87;`

// Only change code below this line
`myVar = myVar + 1;`

-----------------------

**SOLUTION**

var myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line

`myVar++;`
