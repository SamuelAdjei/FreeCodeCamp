**Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript**

We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.

**Example**

`myVar = 16 / 2; // assigned 8`




**CHALLENGE**

Change the 0 so that the `quotient` is equal to 2.

`var quotient = 66 / 0;`


----------------------


**SOLUTION**

`var quotient = 66 / 33;`
