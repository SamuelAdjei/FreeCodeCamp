**Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator**

In JavaScript, when the `+` operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

_Example_
```

'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'

```
**Note**

Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

-----------------

**CHALLENGE**

Build `myStr` from the strings "This is the start. " and "This is the end." using the `+` operator.

1. `myStr` should have a value of This is the start. This is the end.
2. Use the `+` operator to build `myStr`
3. `myStr` should be created using the `var` keyword.
4. Make sure to assign the result to the `myStr` variable.
```
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr;


````

**SOLUTION**
```

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";


```
