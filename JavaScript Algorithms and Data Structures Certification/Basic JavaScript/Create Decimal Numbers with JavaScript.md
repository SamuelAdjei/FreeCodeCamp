**Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript**

We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as `floating point` numbers or `floats`.

Note
Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors. Details Here.

--------------------------------------

**CHALLENGE**

Create a variable `myDecimal` and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. `5.7`).

1. `myDecimal` should be a number.
2. `myDecimal` should have a decimal point

`var ourDecimal = 5.7;`

// Only change code below this line


----------------------------------------
**SOLUTION**

`var ourDecimal = 5.7;`

// Only change code below this line

`var myDecimal = 2.3;`
