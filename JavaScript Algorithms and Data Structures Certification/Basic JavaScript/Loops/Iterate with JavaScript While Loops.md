You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The first type of loop we will learn is called a `"while"` loop because it runs "while" a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.

```
var ourArray = [];
var i = 0;
while(i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
```

Let's try getting a while loop to work by pushing values to an array.




---------------------

**CHALLENEGE**

Push the numbers `0` through 4 to `myArray` using a `while` loop.


```
// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.

```

**SOLUTION**

```
// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.
var i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    myArray.push(i);
    i ++;
}

```
