**Finding a Remainder in JavaScript**


The remainder operator `%` gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

**Example**

`5 % 2 = 1 because`
`Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)`
`2 * 2 = 4`
`5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)`


**Usage**
In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by `2`.

`17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)`
`48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)`


**Note**
The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "modulus" operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.

----------------------------
**CHALLENGE**


Set `remainder` equal to the remainder of `11` divided by `3` using the remainder (`%`) operator.
1. The variable remainder should be initialized
2. The value of remainder should be 2
3. You should use the % operator

// Only change code below this line

`var remainder;`


----------------------
**SOLUTION**

`var remainder = 11 % 3;`
