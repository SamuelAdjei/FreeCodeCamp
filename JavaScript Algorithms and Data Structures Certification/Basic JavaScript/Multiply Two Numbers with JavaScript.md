** Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript**


We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

**Example**

`myVar = 13 * 13; // assigned 169`


**CHALLENGE**

Change the `0` so that product will equal `80`.
1. Make the variable `product` equal 80
2. Use the `*` operator

`var product = 8 * 0;`



**SOLUTION**

`var product = 8 * 10;`
