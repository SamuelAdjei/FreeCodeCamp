**Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String**


`Bracket notation` is a way to get a character at a specific `index` within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

```For example, the character at index 0 in the word "Charles" is "C". So if `var firstName = "Charles"`, you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using `firstName[0]`.```
--------------------------

**CHALLENGE**

Use _bracket notation_ to find the first character in the `lastName` variable and assign it to `firstLetterOfLastName`.

Hint
Try looking at the `firstLetterOfFirstName` variable declaration if you get stuck.

```
1. The `firstLetterOfLastName` variable should have the value of `L`.
2. You should use bracket notation.
// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName;
```

**SOLUTION**
```
// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];



```
